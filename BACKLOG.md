# Estimation Score Calculator Backlog

## Project Rules

- Keep Egyptian Estimation scoring/rules separate from Planning Poker estimation.
- Prefer implementation-ready slices with tests.
- Update `PROJECT_LOG.md` after each automation run.
- Use `PROJECT_RULES.md` as the working rule reference for finalized local Egyptian Estimation rules.
